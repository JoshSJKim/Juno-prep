## Intro to the Internet

### What is a website?

- Website is a collection files and folders that live on a server.
- Visitors can view these files on an internet browser by entering the associated URL (website address) where the files are stored.
- Requested files are pulled through the network and displayed on the browser window.

- Websites are built on three primary languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): The content (words, images, etc.)
  - CSS (Cascading StyleSheets): The framework of the site. "Brick and mortar". Design, color, size, position, layout, etc.
  - JavaScript (JS): User interaction, functional aspect.

### What happens when you visit a webpage?

- URL is typed into the search input field.
- Browser checks history if the site has been visited in the past.
- Once received, the browser pulls up the files for display on the browser window.

### What is the Internet?

- "Physical infrastructure of connected devices that deliver information from one device to another using wires (electricity), cables (light with fiber optics), and/or radio transmitters (sound waves - WiFi)."

- Each device has an IP (internet protocol) address (like a phone number, or street address).
- One device asks for some information from another device by visiting a website.
  - The requesting device lets the providing device know where to send the requested information.

- IP addresses are difficult to remember.
- So we use DNS (Domain Name System) to match URL (Uniform Resource Location) with the specific IP address.

### What is a web browser?

- "An application where users can see and interact with a web resource."
- Best to choose evergreen browsers, which means that the browser is updated frequently, and automatically in the background, without any user action required.

### The Role of a Web Developer

- Front end web developers write code for web browsers to read.
- It is crucial to learn how to communicate with browsers.
  - Since browsers are subject to change frequently, it is the web developer's responsibility to respond to those changes.
