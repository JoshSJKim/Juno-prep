- Going through the Juno web-development bootcamp prep.

## Intro to the Internet

### What is a website?

- Website is a collection files and folders that live on a server.
- Visitors can view these files on an internet browser by entering the associated URL (website address) where the files are stored.
- Requested files are pulled through the network and displayed on the browser window.

- Websites are built on three primary languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): The content (words, images, etc.)
  - CSS (Cascading StyleSheets): The framework of the site. "Brick and mortar". Design, color, size, position, layout, etc.
  - JavaScript (JS): User interaction, functional aspect.

### What happens when you visit a webpage?

- URL is typed into the search input field.
- Browser checks history if the site has been visited in the past.
- Once received, the browser pulls up the files for display on the browser window.

### What is the Internet?

- "Physical infrastructure of connected devices that deliver information from one device to another using wires (electricity), cables (light with fiber optics), and/or radio transmitters (sound waves - WiFi)."

- Each device has an IP (internet protocol) address (like a phone number, or street address).
- One device asks for some information from another device by visiting a website.
  - The requesting device lets the providing device know where to send the requested information.

- IP addresses are difficult to remember.
- So we use DNS (Domain Name System) to match URL (Uniform Resource Location) with the specific IP address.

### What is a web browser?

- "An application where users can see and interact with a web resource."
- Best to choose evergreen browsers, which means that the browser is updated frequently, and automatically in the background, without any user action required.

### The Role of a Web Developer

- Front end web developers write code for web browsers to read.
- It is crucial to learn how to communicate with browsers.
  - Since browsers are subject to change frequently, it is the web developer's responsibility to respond to those changes.

## Keeping Organized as a Developer

### Naming Files and Project Folders

- Developers deal with many projects, and each project has many files and folders, of which many have the same name (ex. index.html).
- It is crucial to maintain an organized file system since these files and folders will be shared with other developers as well.

#### No Spaces!

- Folder names shall not have spaces. It'll only cause problems down the line.
- Use `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, or `underscore_case`
- Whatever you use, consistency is key.
- It is important to communicate with other developers to maintain consistency.

### Development Workspace

- Working on multiple projects can get out of control without proper management.
- Each project will have `index.html` (note that there should be only one of these for every project), and folders named `styles` and `scripts`.

- Create `sites` or `websites` at the root user folder of your computer.
- Organize the folders for projects of different categories.
- Apply a numbering system that represent project ID or dates.
- Organize in a manner that is scalable and makes sense to you

- DO NOT save your folders on a cloud drive. Make sure it is saved on the local drive.

- Lastly, close the files that you are not working on.
- Practice `tab minimalism` across text editors and browsers.
